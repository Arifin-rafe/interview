//What is function curring?
// Currying means converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, 
// each taking one argument at a time

// What is Infinite Currying?
// Infinite currying is a special form of currying where a function can keep returning another
// function indefinitely — until you decide to stop it (usually by calling it without an argument or using a condition).
// So instead of a fixed number of arguments, it accepts an unknown number of them over time.

// what is promise?
// A Promise is a JavaScript object used to handle asynchronous operations —
// it either resolves (success),pending or rejects (failure) and helps avoid messy callback chains.

// What is Event Bubbling?
// Event bubbling starts from the innermost element (the target) and bubbles upwards to its parent elements.

// What is Event Capturing (aka Event Trickling)
// Event capturing starts from the outermost element and travels downwards to the target element.

// let str ="ri ir zyi"
// let rcount = 0
// let icount = 0
// for(let i=0; i<str.length;i++){
//     if(str[i] == "r"){
//         rcount = rcount+1
//     }else if(str[i] == "i"){
//         icount=rcount + 1
//     }
// }
// console.log(rcount,icount)

// What is Temporal Dead Zone?
// TDZ is the period between the start of a block and the point
// where a variable is declared using let or const.
// During this period, accessing the variable will throw a ReferenceError.
// Only applies to let and const, not var.

// What are @keyframes?
// @keyframes is used to create CSS animations by specifying how an element should change styles over time.
// It allows you to define multiple stages (keyframes) of the animation.
