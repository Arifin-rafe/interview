// What are @keyframes?
// @keyframes is used to create CSS animations by specifying how an element should change styles over time.
// It allows you to define multiple stages (keyframes) of the animation.

//virtual dom vs real dom?
//The virtual DOM (Virtual DOM) is a virtual representation of the actual
// DOM (Document Object Model) in a JavaScript environment.
//It is a light-weight representation of the DOM that is used to optimize 
// performance and prevent unnecessary updates to the actual DOM.

//Controlled vs Uncontrolled components?
//Controlled components are those whose state is controlled by the React state or by the user input. //example form
//An uncontrolled component is one where the form data is handled by the DOM itself, not by React state.// useRef

// Redux is built on 3 rules —
// (1) One central store,
// (2) State can’t be changed directly,
// (3) State changes happen through pure reducers.
