// useState vs useReducer?
// useState is used for simple state management, 
// like toggles or counters, where you update state directly.
// useReducer is used for complex state logic,
// where multiple actions or related values are managed through a reducer 
// function — similar to Redux.

// How to handle form validation?
// Use HTML validation for small forms.
// Use React state/manual checks for moderate forms.
// Use React Hook Form + Yup for complex or large forms (best practice).

// Library vs Framework explain in short?
// A library is a collection of prewritten code that you call when needed — 
// it helps you do specific tasks (e.g., React, jQuery).
// A framework provides a complete structure for your application and
// calls your code instead — you follow its rules and architecture (e.g., Angular, Django).

// What is Dynamic Routing?
// Dynamic routing means creating routes that change based on data or parameters,
// like user IDs or product names.

// Figure vs img tag in HTML?
// Figure tag is used to display an image with a caption, 
// while the img tag is used to display an image without a caption.

// Difference between <em> tag vs <i> tagg in html?
// Use <em> for emphasis or importance (semantic).
// Use <i> for purely stylistic italic text (visual).

// Sudo class vs Sudo elements?
// A pseudo-class defines a special state of an element — like when you hover, click, or focus it.
// A pseudo-element lets you style a specific part of an element — like the first letter or content before/after it.

// How to overlap in css?
// Use z-index to overlap elements.
